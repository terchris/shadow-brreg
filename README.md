# The shadow database of all companies in Norway

NB !!! Rewriting from downloading excel to downloading json -- so testing now..

shadow-brreg is a system that creates a shadow database copy of all companies in Norway ( 1 million ). Enables you to play with machine learning, data science, data analysis, and data visualization on your local machine with relevant data.

Will run on any machine (Mac, Windows, Linux) in a docker container. Automatic installation of the database and automatic update of the database.  Updated every minute with all changes from Norwegian public company registration, Brønnøysundregistrene (www.brreg.no)

Just copy one file "docker-compose.yml" to your local machine and start it with the command `docker compose up -d`

* If you are using a Mac or Windows you need to install docker desktop. <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop> If you are using Linux you know what to do.

# Code written by ChatGPT, Github Copilot and me

The code for the automatic update of the database is written by ChatGPT,  @terchris, and Github Copilot. In plain English, I asked ChatGPT to write the code and he/she/it did. ChatGPT is unstable so I wrote all my questions in a file before pasting the question to ChatGPT. As I was writing my questions, Github Copilot suggested how to write the questions in plain English.  So there I got one AI helping me to talk to another AI.

What impressed me the most was that ChatGPT was able to understand that the database table (brreg_enheter_alle) contains organizations. So I could ask it to do stuff like this:

>The table brreg_enheter_alle is a table of organizations. The number of employees are defined by the field antall_ansatte. Create a new function named getLargestOrganizations that returns the records that has the most employees. Sort the results so that the organization with the largest amount of employees is at the top. There are many records in the table so it must be possible to pass a parameter named numberOfOrganizations to the function getLargestOrganizations that defines how many organizations to return. Use the already defined function displayRecords to display the result.

And ChatGPT wrote the code for me. I just had to copy and paste it into the file and run it. Before I asked ChatGPT to write code for me I asked 20 questions about how to set up the development environment for accessing the database, typescript compiler options, getting debugging to work properly in vscode, and so on.

## A lifetime to master

Databases have their own language, SQL. The saying is that SQL takes a day to learn and a lifetime to master. With ChatGPT you can say what you want in plain English. And ChatGPT will write the SQL for you.

>write the sql statement that find the organisations that has the most employees and does not have a hjemmeside field or the hjemmeside field is empty

```sql
SELECT navn, antall_ansatte FROM brreg_enheter_alle WHERE (hjemmeside IS NULL OR hjemmeside = '') ORDER BY antall_ansatte DESC LIMIT 10;
```

In the answer here ChatGPT has limited the result to 10 records. This is because, in my previous question, I asked ChatGPT to write a function that returns the 10 largest organizations. So ChatGPT knows that I want to limit the result to 10 records.

## You can define concepts

You can define concepts and then use them in your queries. This is how I defined the concept of `bankrupt`. I also told ChatGPT that the field stiftelsesdato is a date. It seems that ChatGPT already knows the concept of oldest and that it can be applied to dates.  

>When the field konkurs is set to something different than NEI it means that the company is bankrupt. The field stiftelsesdato is the date that the company was created. Write a sql that lists name, stiftelsesdato and antall ansatte of the 10 oldest companies that are bankrupt.

```sql
SELECT navn, stiftelsesdato, antall_ansatte
FROM brreg_enheter_alle
WHERE konkurs != 'NEI'
ORDER BY stiftelsesdato ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

## A tutor sitting next to you is not cheating

I learned a lot from the experiment. New ways of writing code that I was not aware of.
It was like having a teacher sitting next to me. Its a lot of talk these days on how ChatGPT helps students to cheat on exams. I think that we need to look at the other side of this. ChatGPT can help students to learn new topics faster and more efficiently.

## But what when you cant write plain english?

There was one more AI assisting me, Copilot and ChatGPT. I'm dyslectic and I often misspell words. I use a chrome plugin named Grammarly that checks and rates the readability of the questions I ask ChatGPT. ChatGPT gives better answers when the questions are precise.

## But what if you dont know english?

You can even write the question in your native language. This is how I, in Norwegian, asked ChatGPT to list all organizations that have gone bankrupt.

>Lag sql som lister navn og antall ansatte i organisasjoner som ikke har feltet konkurs satt til NEI. Gi meg topp 10 og sorter slik at den med flest ansatte er øverst.

```sql
SELECT navn, antall_ansatte FROM brreg_enheter_alle WHERE konkurs != 'NEI' ORDER BY antall_ansatte DESC LIMIT 10;
```

# Purpose of shadow-brreg is to make it easy to get access to the data from brreg.no

shadow-brreg will spin up a container that holds a Postgres database with all data from brreg.no

The database holds more than a million records. And you can use it to play with machine learning, data science, data analysis, data visualization, and so on.

To get you started there is a web-based tool for querying the database, pgAdmin. I have included a simple howto for how to use pgAdmin to query the database.

If you want to take it further and write code to access the database you can use a ready-set-up project named shadow-brreg-node.

## Getting started

1. Download the only file you need. The docker-compose.yml file
2. Start the container as described in the section "Just one file to set it up"
3. Set up pgAdmin so that you can access the database from your browser [read pgAdmin setup](pgadmin-setup.md)
4. Register and get login to ChatGPT [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
5. Ask ChatGPT to write code for you. [Read how to ask ChatGPT to write code for you](1chatgpt.md)
6. If you are a developer you can create your own program.

* [Use the code shadow-brreg-node as starting point if you are a node developer](https://github.com/terchris/shadow-brreg-node)

* missing: Use the code shadow-brreg-python if you are a python developer

# Documentation of the experiment

When creating shadow-brreg i asked ChatGPT 115 questions.
[You will find all questions and answers here](https://github.com/terchris/shadow-brreg-node/blob/main/chatGPT.MD) Note that the first 20 questions are about setting up the development environment. The rest are about the code for the automatic update of the database.

You will find the code written by ChatGPT, Github Copilot, and me in the repository: <https://github.com/terchris/shadow-brreg-node> The code is in the file [index.ts](https://github.com/terchris/shadow-brreg-node/blob/main/src/index.ts)

## Some inconsitency in the way ChatGPT writes code

The coding style varies a lot in the code that ChatGPT gives you. I can understand this as ChatGPT is trained on code from many developers.

So when I had to write the code for the automatic update of the database (in this shadow-brreg repository) I had to change the coding style so that it would be easier to read. (parameter names and how to return values from functions)

# Just one file to set it up

To start the whole thing you need just one file. The docker-compose.yml file. This file will download the latest version of the database and start the automatic updating of the database.
You can copy & paste the file or download it with wget or curl.

* copy the docker-compose.yml file to your local dir

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terchris/shadow-brreg/main/docker-compose.yml -O docker-compose.yml
```

or

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terchris/shadow-brreg/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
```

* start the container

In the directory where you downloaded the docker-compose.yml file type:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

# Techincal notes

## First time setup

It takes a long time to download and set up the database the first time you start the container. If you want to see what is going on the first time you can open a terminal and type:

```bash
docker compose up
```

When you omit the -d parameter the container will run in the foreground and you can see what is going on. Pressing control C will stop the container.

The first time you start the container it will download an excel file (enheter_alle.xlsx) from Brønnøysundregistrene (brreg.no). The file is 195 MB in size. The download will take some time depending on your internet connection. brreg.no uses the proprietary Microsoft format xlsx. In order to import the file into the database it must be converted to the open format CSV. This also takes some time.
It would have a lot easyer for all of us if brreg.no had used the open format CSV and compressed the file.

1. Containers are started as defined in the docker-compose.yml file
2. The script [shadow-init.sh](shadow-init.sh) is downloaded and executed inside the containerThe script installs programs, download data, converts to CSV, and imports to the database. [This is the log from the initial startup of shadow-brreg system](initial-startup-log.md)

## Start the container

In the directory where you downloaded the docker-compose.yml file type:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Stop the container

In the directory where you downloaded the docker-compose.yml file type:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Check how many records are imported to the table

```bash
docker exec -it shadow-app cat /usr/src/app/database_initiated.txt
```

The result should be something like this:

```text
Tue Jan 17 10:58:44 UTC 2023
  count  
---------
 1048575
(1 row)
```

## Updating the database

Changes brreg.no does to their data are fetched and updated in the local database every minute. All changes they do to the data are available in the database. So you don't have to do anything to get the latest data. If you stop the container and start it again it will find the changes since the last time and update the database.

## passwords and security

The database user is `postgres` and the password is `postgres` and everyone that has access to your host at port 5433 can add and delete stuff in your database.
I suggest that you edit the script and change the password. Or safest. Just stop the container when you are not using it.

## How to access the database from your code

The database is available on port 5433 on the host. This is so that the port does not interfere with other postgresql instances you may have.

An example of how to access the database from your code:

```TypeScript
async function getOrganizations(query: string, limit: number): Promise<any[]> {

    let rows: any[] = [];
    try {
        const res = await pool.query(`${query} LIMIT $1`, [limit]);
        rows = res.rows;
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
    return rows;
}
```

```text
databasename: importdata
user: postgres
password: postgres
table: brreg_enheter_alle
port: 5433
```

## About disk space

The database (docker volume) takes about 733 MB on disk. The database is updated every minute and we keep track of all changes. So it will grow over time. If you don't need to keep track of changes you can just delete all (images, containers, volumes) and start over again. The database will be downloaded again and you will have a fresh database with all organizations.
