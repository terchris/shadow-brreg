# AI assisted data science

## Introduction

With the advent of AI, data science has become more accessible to the masses. AI is a powerful tool that can be used to automate many of the tasks that are currently done by humans. This allows data scientists to focus on the more important tasks of data science, such as data exploration, feature engineering, and model building. In this article, we will discuss how AI can be used to automate some of the tasks that are currently done by humans.

## Data exploration

Data exploration is the process of analyzing data to find patterns and relationships. It is an important step in the data science process because it allows data scientists to understand the data they are working with. Data exploration can be done manually, but it is often done using automated tools. These tools can be used to find patterns and relationships in the data, and they can also be used to visualize the data.
